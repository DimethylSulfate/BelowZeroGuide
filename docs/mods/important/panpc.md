:material-tag-plus: `Optional` | 
:simple-discord: `Discord` | 
:material-medical-bag: `Patch Required`

Overhauls the AI completely. NPCs act smarter, use strategies, behave more realistic and use individual AI based on gameplay situations and their factions. 
It is the best AI mod for Fallout 4 and is developed by Greslin, a programmer who has several decades of programming and gaming knowledge.

Why isn't this mod hosted on Nexus? You can ask Greslin himself on his Discord Server if you want.
