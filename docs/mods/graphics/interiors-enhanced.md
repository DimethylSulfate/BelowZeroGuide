## [Interiors Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8768)
:material-tag-plus: `Optional`
:material-medical-bag: `Patch Required`

Ambient light power and fog brightness inside all interiors reduced by 60%, without touching any directional light sources whatsoever, keeping lighting 100% true to vanilla except for those dark corners and unlit areas. Subways are actually dark and scary! Not just a filter, actual light data has been altered. All-DLC covered.
