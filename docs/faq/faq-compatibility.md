## Can I easily switch between FROST and vanilla Fallout 4?

*How can I switch between vanilla Fallout 4 and FROST?*
*Can I have multiple mod setups at the same time?*

Due to its nature of FROST being a total overhaul, it is not compatible with many other popular mods, like Sim Settlements 2.
However, it is possible for you to have multiple independent mod setups, one for **FROST** and the others can be any different mod setup for Fallout 4 of your liking.

This can be achieved by simply using multiple Mod Organizer Profiles or Instances, or by using Vortex Profile feature.
However, you other setups need to be tailored with some things in mind:

* They should not contain mods that rely on the free CC mods from the **Next-Gen** update
* All the mods in it need to work on Fallout 4 version **1.10.163**
    * This especially applies to UFO4P and F4SE mods with ddl files
* You need to use the **Backported BA2 Support System** mod in your non-FROST setups.

## Which mods for FROST are outdated or broken?
Many frost mods and patches before 2019 have a high probability to be outdated or badly made, and will break things.
A few FROST mods which were made after 2019 are also problematic.
A list of these mods can be found **[here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3392)**. This list might not be complete.
The **[Automatic Load Order Checker from Section 9](/guide/load-order-setup/#automatic-load-order-checker)** does know some of those incompatible mods. Make sure to use it to detect incompatible mods.

## What do I need to do when adding more mods?

### Before adding new mods
1. Check if they have a FROST patch that you might need
2. Check if they might be an incompatible mod according to the criteria above

### After adding new mods
1. Sort your load order according to the **[sorting rules from Section 9 "Load Order"](/guide/load-order-setup/#load-order-structure)**.
2. Check your load order with the **[Automatic Load Order Checker from Section 9](/guide/load-order-setup/#automatic-load-order-checker)**


## Will pirated copies work?

Piracy is not supported in any way, shape, or form. Any proof that you're using a pirated copy or piracy-related talk will lead to a ban from the FROST Discord server and Nexusmods pages. 

## Is Linux supported?

We cannot provide support for Linux. As Linux enthusiasts, we would love to provide Linux support, but this is simple out-of-scope for us due to time and resource limitations. 
FROST and the other mods featured in this guide work with Linux once you set up your mod manager under Linux properly, and after installing Wine/Proton etc.
