## Any mod recommendations?

Yes, we have recommendations for additional mods that either work out of the box or need a patch, like weapon mods.
Check out the [Additional Mods Section](../../additional-mods).

## Before adding more mods...
... you should check if your game is actually working properly. Start Fallout 4 through your mod manager with F4SE, and follow the entire intro sequence of FROST. Follow [Section 10. "Starting the Game"](../guide/starting-game). If you encounter any problems, read [Section 11. "Troubleshooting"](../guide/troubleshooting). If there are not any issues, you can continue following the current section

## Installing and uninstalling mods mid-playthrough
Installing or uninstalling mods mid-playthrough can cause save files to be corrupted, or (semi-)persistent issues in your playthrough (broken NPCs, broken items, ...). 
Some can be removed or added mid-playthrough without issues, like texture mods, others can't be removed (like mods with scripts) or only removed under special circumstances (if they have special uninstallation instructions).

Be careful with what you add or remove mid-playthrough. 
If you encounter issues, you might need to start a New Game after fixing them.

## Outdated FROST Mods
Many frost mods and patches before 2019 have a high probability to be outdated or badly made, and will break things.
A few FROST mods which were made after 2019 are also problematic.
A list of these mods can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/articles/3392). This list does not contain every outdated FROST mod!
