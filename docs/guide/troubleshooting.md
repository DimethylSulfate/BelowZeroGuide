!!! info "Don't have any issues?"
    This section is optional and should only be read in case you ran into issues. If you followed sections 1-10 properly, you can start playing FROST, or you can go to [Section 12 "Adding more mods"](../adding-more-mods) if you want to add some additional mods.

## What went wrong?

If followed this guide, and noticed an issue (CTDs, FPS drops, game doesn't start, ...), several things can be the cause of that.

1. You didn't follow the guide correctly
    * You have incompatible mods lingering in your game's Data folder, this is why a [clean slate](../initial-game-setup#making-a-clean-install-of-fallout-4) is required.
    * You didn't read the [**Requirements**](../introduction/requirements.md) section
    * You did not sort your mods correctly
    * ...
2. The guide has an issue, considering that this guide was remade recently errors could have slipped in
3.  If you are using a third-party antivirus, add exclusions to the folder Mod Organizer 2 is in. If that doesn't work, try disabling the antivirus completely and rely solely on Windows Defender (which should work fine once exclusions are present).
4. Your hardware or drivers cause an issue (unlikely, but this can happen)
5. Certain settings in mods need to be changed (unlikely, but this can happen and is often related to 4.)
6. One of the mods from the Below Zero guide has a bug causing your issue
7. You've added additional mods, and they directly or indirectly cause the issue
8. You used quicksaves (they can cause issues with save files in modded setups)
9. You've installed or uninstalled certain mods mid-playthrough


**In any of those cases, we will help you to fix the issue.**
